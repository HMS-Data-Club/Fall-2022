# Data Club - Session 1

This session will focus on exploratory analysis and data visualization. We will work together to pull datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the [New York Times GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), examine the data, and create useful visualizations.


Specifically, the goals of this session are:

* Review data wrangling using tidyverse and data visualization using ggplot2
* Explore code for generating interactive / animated plots
* Identify practices that promote reproducible worklow
