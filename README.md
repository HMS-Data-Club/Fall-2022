## About Data Club

The Data Analysis Club is a community hosted by the Center for Computational Biomedicine with support from the Curriculum Fellows. In Fall 2022, we will be focusing on hands-on data analysis using R. Each session, either the instructor(s) or another group member will introduce a data set and a research question. As a group, we will work through the workflow to show how we can use data to answer a question, test a hypothesis, or reproduce a result. We will also have time each session to troubleshoot projects and share computational expertise. Members will have a say in the specific topics and data techniques chosen for each session, but expect topics such as:

* Project and workflow management
* Data visualization and exploratory analysis
* Analyzing high-throughput data

All sessions will take place __in person__ in TMEC 128 on Thursdays from 4:00pm – 5:30pm.
